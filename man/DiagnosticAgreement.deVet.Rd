\title{Calculating agreement for dichotomous variables.}
\usage{
DiagnosticAgreement.deVet(ratings, CI = T, ConfLevel = 0.95,
  correction = c("continuity", "Fleiss", "bootstrap"), NrBoot = 1000,
  Parallel = F, no_cores = detectCores() - 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ratings}{A dataframe or matrix of N x P with N the number of observations and P the number of raters.}

\item{CI}{Logical, indicates if confidence intervals have to be calculated}

\item{ConfLevel}{The confidence level to be used in calculating the confidence intervals. Possible values
are \code{"continuity"}, \code{"Fleiss"} and \code{"bootstrap"}.}

\item{correction}{Method of calculating the confidence intervals (de Vet et al., 2017). The confidence intervals (CI) can be calculated using
continuity correction, Fleiss correction or by use of bootstrap samples.}

\item{NrBoot}{In case of bootstrap methodology to calculate the CI, the number of bootstrap samples.}

\item{Parallel}{Logical, indicates if parallel computing has to be used to compute the confidence intervals.
Implemented only when using bootstrapping to calculate the confidence intervals.}

\item{no_cores}{Number of cores if parallel computing is used. Default is 1 core less than the number of
cores present.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:

\item{SumTable}{The summed table as defined in the article of de Vet et al. (2017)}

\item{ObservedAgreem}{The overall proportion of agreement (with CI).}

\item{SpecificAgreem}{The specific agreement for each of the categories (with CIs).}
}
\description{
Function to calculate specific agreement and overall proportion of agreement for dichotomous variables.
}
\details{
This function is based on the functions as given in the appendix of the article of de Vet et al. (2017).
